   "source": "# Challenge 2.2\n\n## Objective\n\nCreate a script that can generate a fraction consisting of 10 unique digits on the numerator and 10 unique digits on the denominator that can be a close approximation of PI. So, each number (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,0) can only be used once in the numerator and same for the denominator.\n\n## Hints\n\n- You will probably use random numbers (`import random`) for either the denominator or the numerator\n- Use a list for creating the random unique numbers\n- Also, add the math module, it contains PI `math.pi` (`import math`)\n- You will probably use loops\n- This is simpler than you think\n\n## Solution\n\nWrite below your solution.\nThis is one of the many answers that could be generated through a good script:"

These data files contain a lot of information about file transfers for this experiment. We are going to take how many jobs started in one day. We will then plot this data in a histogram with the bin size being 1 hour.\n\n[Link to the data](https://target2018.onlineth.com/wp-content/uploads/nova_fullday_2016-04-05.nodetype.csv)\n\nHere is the header which has been removed from the csv file,\n\n```csv\nJobID,JobStartTime(unix timestamp),FileID,FileSize(byte),NodeName,FileProcessingTime(second),FileTransferTime(second),NodeType,FileTransferRate(byte/s)\n```\n\n## Hints\n\n- Take a look at the matplotlib histogram script you did in the lesson\n- Most of the data in the data file for what we are trying to do is irrelevant, pay attention just to how many jobs were in a particular hour\n- To find this, you are given a jobStartTime which is a unix timestamp, lookup how to get an hour of the day from this timestamp, then count how many are in each hour\n\n## Solution\n\nWrite below your solution."
